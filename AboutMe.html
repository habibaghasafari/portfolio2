									<h4>About Me:</h4>
									<p style="text-align: justify">I am a highly intelligent engineering student based in Sydney. I am an excellent software engineer who is specialised in Robotics and Mechatronics. 
										What differentiates me from other applicants is that you don’t have to rely on my word or others to be sure of my skills, you can see them in action in this website. This website demonstrates my vast knowledge and skills in Robotics, Computer vision, software development and more.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify">While I have many technical skills that are relevant to the fields of Robotics and Mechatronics, the most important thing about me is that I love programming robots. I enjoy writing code and then see my code play out in the real world. 
										That is why I will never stop learning new skills. I am never satisfied with what I can do with my robotic projects. As soon as I achieve a milestone, I immediately want to achieve something greater.
										I am a creative problem solver, I am a fast learner and have adaptive personality and can work autonomously or be part of a team.  </p>
									<p style="text-align: justify">I am currently looking to join an innovative company in the field of Robotics. If you are an employer from an innovative Robotic company, please don’t hesitate to contact me at habib.aghasafari@student.uts.edu.au</p>
