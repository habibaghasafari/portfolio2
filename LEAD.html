									<h4>Leadership:</h4>
									<p style="text-align: justify">During my university course, I have done many assignment and projects as part of a group. In most of these groups, I contributed the most and took on the most difficult portion of the task. Because of this, I usually also take on the job of coordinating the group member's tasks. For this reason, I usually emerge as the leader of my group. All of these experiences have given me a lot of practice. Along the way, I learned many things on how to be a good leader. One of the most important parts is having a good and detailed plan on the group objectives and periodically realign decisions based on those objectives.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify">I believe a good leader is also a good project manager. But being a good leader and project manager is easier said than done, especially for technically gifted engineers like me. I always have this engineering desire to build new things and explore endless possibilities. This enables me to be a brilliant engineer. But it can also distract me from the project's primary objectives, which will lead to inefficiencies in the project. To be a good leader, I think I need to find a way to somewhat control my curiosity engine and keep re-focusing on the project objectives and plans. Looking back on my  <a href="TRVR.html">capstone project</a>, I think that I have made good progress on this part.</p>
